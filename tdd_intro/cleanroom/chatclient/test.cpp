 * After establishing connection - handshake is performed:
    * client writes message with it's nickname and ':HELLO!' string to socket ("client:HELLO!")
    * server responses with it's nickname and ':HELLO!' magic ("server:HELLO!")
        * if server receives malformated message - it drops connection with this client
        * if client receives malformated message - it drops connection and exits
