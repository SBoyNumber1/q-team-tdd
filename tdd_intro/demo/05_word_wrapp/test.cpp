/*
Write a function, that is given a string and a length limit, splits provided string into sequence of string,
where length of each string is not more, than provided limit. If there are spaces under provided limit -
last space should be used to wrapp this line. If there are no spaces - wrapp it on provided length limit.

Example:
When pos is specified, the search only includes sequences of characters that begin at or before position pos, ignoring any possible match beginning after pos

"When pos is specified, the",
"search only includes sequences",
"of characters that begin at or",
"before position pos, ignoring",
"any possible match beginning",
"after pos."
