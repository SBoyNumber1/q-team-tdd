Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (converter http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html)

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.

To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.
In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:
1000=M 900=CM 90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:
2000=MM 8=VIII

1998 is written as MCMXCVIII.
